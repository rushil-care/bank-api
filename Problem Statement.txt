Problem Statement: Write a REST-based API that enables transfer of money from one bank account to another. Please keep in mind that money transfers are inherently transactional in nature.

1. Account types are 'Savings', 'Current' and 'BasicSavings'. A single user can have multiple such accounts. The following rules apply:

2. Transfer between accounts belonging to the same user is not allowed.

3. The balance in 'BasicSavings' account type should never exceed Rs. 50,000

4. Source account should have the required amount for the transaction to succeed

The API spec follows: (All amounts in the API are in paisa)
Input (JSON)

fromAccountId
toAccountId
amount


Output (JSON)

success case:
newSrcBalance: The balance in source account after transfer
totalDestBalance: The total balance in all accounts of destination user combined
transferedAt: timestamp

failure case:
errorCode
errorMessage


Any language, framework and database would do. Our preference would be Node.js since it is most commonly used across our stacks, but that is not mandatory. Please provide instructions on how to run it. Include some sample users/accounts data to test for various scenarios. Around 10 or so sample accounts should suffice to cover the scenarios.
